Compilation of useful resources for frontend web developers. Work in progress. Currently unsorted with no categorisation. But there might be! 

If you want to contribute: 

- Fork the project repository to create a copy of the codebase under your GitHub account.
- Make the necessary changes, in this case updating the resources-list.md file.
- Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message directly on GitHub. 
- No need to download your clone and run local since this project will only contain text files - also code editors auto-format
- So please avoid sending a PR coming from a autoformatted local copy
- From your forked repository, create a pull request (PR) to the original repository's branch where you want your changes to be merged into. 
- Once your PR is approved, your changes will be merged into the original project repository

Thanks.
